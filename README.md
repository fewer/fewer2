# fewer2

A re-thinking of the core Fewer APIs

## TODO:

- Generate table name with camelCase + pluralize.
- Allow for customizing the table name (static tableName = 'user')
- Figure out what multi-database support looks like.
- Add initialization hook.
	- This is also probably where we'll add stuff like the ability to add validation.
